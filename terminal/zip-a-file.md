# Zip a file

This comes in handy especially whenever you want to download multiples files from a server or take backups.

```bash
zip [option] output_file input1 input2
```

For example: if you want to zip an entire directory with it's file contents, just do this:
```bash
zip -r myfiles.zip folder/
```
